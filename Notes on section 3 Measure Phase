--- VOC --- 
Voice of consumers (vague) but opinion of customers
CTQ Critial to quality are not so vague 
Choosing a measure method 
Questionnaires or interviews or observation 
1 Questionnaires use closed and straigthforward questions Efficient and independent 
2 Interview take more time but gives more insights. Usually range between 10 and 30 
3 Observation. We do that in cases where no one knows about the project or cant answer the questions 

--- Measuring Scales ---

Nominal or categorical variables features: Words cannot be put in low-high scale
Ordinal: Words or range of numbers that can be put in low-high scale
Parametric: numbers not range of them (gives more freedom to analytical methods)
YOU CANNOT UPGRADE; ALWAYS DOWNGRADE

--- Central Tendency ---
Mode : Values that pops up the most (used for nominal scale)
Median : Value in the middle when values are put in order
Arithmetic mean: Average 
Geometric mean: Suitable for percentual CHANGES (arithmetic is now). put all numbers in decimals and multiply them
...then raise to 1/n of observations. This is the mean per year (in this case)

--- MEAN OR MEDIAN? ---
Use both. Mean is more sensitive to bigger values
Median is the middle term of all terms 

--- SAMPLE OR POPULATION
Sample is considered a subset of the population (n)
Population is all data (N)

--- SAMPLING TECHNIQUES ---
Probability sampling techniques (same chance for all population)

Non-probability sampling techniques (not same chance for all population). 
- Sample less representative
- Convenient
- First encountered
