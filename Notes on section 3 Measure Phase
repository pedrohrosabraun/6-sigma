--- VOC --- 
Voice of consumers (vague) but opinion of customers
CTQ Critial to quality are not so vague 
Choosing a measure method 
Questionnaires or interviews or observation 
1 Questionnaires use closed and straigthforward questions Efficient and independent 
2 Interview take more time but gives more insights. Usually range between 10 and 30 
3 Observation. We do that in cases where no one knows about the project or cant answer the questions 

--- Measuring Scales ---

Nominal or categorical variables features: Words cannot be put in low-high scale
Ordinal: Words or range of numbers that can be put in low-high scale
Parametric: numbers not range of them (gives more freedom to analytical methods)
YOU CANNOT UPGRADE; ALWAYS DOWNGRADE

--- Central Tendency ---
Mode : Values that pops up the most (used for nominal scale)
Median : Value in the middle when values are put in order
Arithmetic mean: Average 
Geometric mean: Suitable for percentual CHANGES (arithmetic is now). put all numbers in decimals and multiply them
...then raise to 1/n of observations. This is the mean per year (in this case)

--- MEAN OR MEDIAN? ---
Use both. Mean is more sensitive to bigger values
Median is the middle term of all terms 

--- SAMPLE OR POPULATION
Sample is considered a subset of the population (n)
Population is all data (N)

--- SAMPLING TECHNIQUES ---
Probability sampling techniques (same chance for all population)
- Considers the whole population (like a lottery)
-- Systematic sampling every n th sample is pick

-- Stratified sampling (GOLDEN STANDARD) - ONLY IF YOU KNOW THE PROPORTIONS!!!!!
Takes into account the proportion of between the different types of your sample (cars and people, blue and black). than calculates the strata and takes this into account when sampling 

Non-probability sampling techniques (not same chance for all population). 
- Sample less representative
- Convenient
- First encountered 

--- NORMAL DISTRIBUTION ---
Only for parametric data (visual inspection, simmetry, peak in the middle)
You can plot it using seaborn and countplot or histogram
Mathematic inspection (tests) - Smirnov-test p-value to reject the null hypothesis 

RULE OF THUMB 
68, 95, 99% fall into sigma, 2sigma, 3 sigma, respectively 

Z-SCORE TABLE (ROUGHLY ESTIMATION BECAUSE OF THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTUON NOT PERFECT ALSO)
- Score is the sample number Z=(Score/mean)/(standard deviation) 
- Then you read your Z on the table and the last digits 
- The number found is the remaining area (percentage) on the curve. it means how far is the data from the mean
- A z-score tells us the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean of a given distribution. negative z-scores indicate the value lies below the mean. positive z-scores indicate the value lies above the mean.
