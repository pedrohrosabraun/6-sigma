--- Analyze phase ---
Root cause of your problem??
QUALITATIVE TOOLS: 5 WHY ANALYSIS (keep asking "why" like a child 5 times)
QUANTITATIVE TOOLS: CORRELATION, REGRESSION etc

--- PITFALLS ---
1 Correlation is different then causality
2 Correlation only for linear
3 Outliers can have a drastic effect when calculating the correlation


--- OLS Ordinary least squares ---
Residuals: distance between regression function and raw data (y axis)
Homoscedastic: Residuals distributed evenly
Heteroscedastic: Residuals distributed unevenly
Use LinearRegression from sklearn models in Python to get the Rsquared 

--- MULTIPLE ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION ---
Takes into account more then 1 variable. 
It quantifies the effect of variables as pure effect (only 1 variable when keeping the others variable)
When using Multiple OLS Y:parametric // X: parametric or nominal (binary)
- we have to avoid correlation between the studied variables 
here you can use sns.heatmap to check correlation between variables 
threshold of 0.8 
- avoid too many variables
- use enough data 30+15

ANOVA table - check the F significance value. Has to be smaller than 0.05 
Then check the table of coefficients. It calculates coefficients considering the 1 or more variable is maintained constant
