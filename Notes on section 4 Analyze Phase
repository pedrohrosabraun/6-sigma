--- Analyze phase ---
Root cause of your problem??

--- PITFALLS ---
1 Correlation is different then causality
2 Correlation only for linear
3 Outliers can have a drastic effect when calculating the correlation


--- OLS Ordinary least squares ---
Residuals: distance between regression function and raw data (y axis)
Homoscedastic: Residuals distributed evenly
Heteroscedastic: Residuals distributed unevenly
Use LinearRegression from sklearn models in Python to get the Rsquared
