DOE, PokeYoke, Lean Visual Management

--- DOE ---
Factorial Design (>1 Factors like 2 factors and with levels)
Number of experiments depends on the levels of each factors (multiply by themselves)
We have also the interaction effect 

--- Poka yoke ---
Mistakes by the operator 
Then you make something mistake proof
Requires inspection, repair or rework (non-value added activity)

--- Lean visuals --- 
kanban boards, shadow boards, andon and floor markings (airport for example).
Floor Markings (make it easier, safe)
Andon - colorful light signals 
Shadow boards - Place like a board to place all tools and everyone can see if something is missing or
everything is ready for the next day
Kanban boards - sticky notes - to do , doing, done (place the board where there is high traffic)
